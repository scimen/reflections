When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Collaborating with other people
Accessing my code from different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It is possible that the local code is not ready for sharing with other people.
There might be more than one contributors to a repository, and conflicts may occur.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

Forks and clones are similar, and operates on repositories. These are mainly used for
creating an exact replica of the repo. The difference is Fork is used from Github to
Github, and clone is used for Local to Local and Github to Local.

On the other hand branches are just labels for some commits. You used branches in an
existing repo to distinguish commits corresponding to different functionality.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

it helps us to identify changes and conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

by exchanging the code and the changes made. But it would be harder to detect conflicts and
would require some time to merge changes manually.
