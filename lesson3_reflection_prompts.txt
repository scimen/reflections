When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Collaborating with other people
Accessing my code from different computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It is possible that the local code is not ready for sharing with other people.
There might be more than one contributors to a repository, and conflicts may occur.
