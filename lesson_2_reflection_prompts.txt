What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates metadata that is required to keep track of the files (in hidden .git directory).

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

working directory keeps all the changes, whereas staging area keeps the changes we would like to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Only adding the logical changes to the stating area ensures that my commit it logical.
In other words, it separates the commit from the actual changes that has been carried out in the working directory.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

to separate working (master)/development/experimental codes

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
